Insights:

1- Audience Retention: Users aged 31-40 demonstrate the highest video retention rate at 65.73%, indicating strong content relevance for this segment. In contrast, users aged 13-20 exhibit the lowest retention rate (41.19%). While this younger group generates high 3-second views, their 1-minute view conversion is lower, suggesting that the content hook beyond the initial seconds is less effective.

2- Gender Behaviors: Female users contribute the highest engagement share at 37.71%, outperforming other gender segments across all engagement metrics.

3- Geographic Performance: Australia and France are the top-performing markets in terms of engagement, whereas Japan ranks lowest with 47K engagements.

4- Engagement by Age: The senior segment (>51) accounts for the largest share of engagement across likes, shares, and comments. Conversely, the 13-20 age group contributes the least, suggesting a need to adapt content to better capture and retain younger users.

5- Hobbies & Interests: Users interested in Gaming and Dancing drive the highest engagement, while those interested in Cooking and Photography contribute the least.

Recommendations:

1- Content Targeting: Focus on creating content tailored to the 50+ age group, as they deliver the highest retention and sustained engagement.

2- Optimize Early Hooks: Enhance the first 3-5 seconds of videos targeting the 13-20 segment to improve long-term view retention.

3- Gender-Based Strategy: Develop campaigns specifically aimed at female audiences, leveraging their higher engagement levels.

4- Market Focus: Increase spend and influencer collaborations in high-performing markets like France and Australia, while testing localized content strategies in lower-performing regions such as Japan.
